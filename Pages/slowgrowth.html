                    <p class="text002">Slow hair growth is becoming more common for both men and women. This is partially due to poor diets and stressful lifestyles. It can become particularly problematic as we get older or go through a stressful period in life.
                       <br> <br> Hair that grows slowly can be accompanied by thinning, lifeless, and overall lackluster hair that just does not look as good as it used to.
                       <br> <br> Improving the speed at which your hair grows is possible. In turn, the overall health, shine, thickness, quality, and texture of your hair should improve.

                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >To understand why your hair is not growing as fast as it used to, it is first important to understand how hair grows. The cycle takes place over three phases. They are :
                                  <br>  Anagen;
                                  <br> Catagen; and
                                  <br> Telogen.
                                  <br><br> Here is a closer look at each phase. <br> <br>
                                    
                                    <span class="text99">
                                        Anagen
                                    </span> <br> <br> 
                                    <br> Also known as the active growth phase, anagen lasts anywhere from two to seven years. It begins towards the end of telogen, the last phase in the cycle (see below). There are actually a few steps before an anagen hair shaft even makes its appearance on the surface of the scalp:<br>
                                    <br><br> 1. The hair follicle enlarges and deepens. This happens because more nutrients and blood supply are required for a new hair to form. This increased supply will be delivered by the Dermal Papilla (the structure at the very bottom of the follicle).
                                    <br><br> 2. A hair bulb forms at the base of the follicle. Once the follicle has deepened enough, the bulb is able to form. This bulb is the very start of a hair strand, and it will play a big role in development.
                                    <br><br>3. The follicle fully attaches to the DP. With the bulb in place, the follicle can now receive blood and nutrients from the DP.
                                    <br><br> 4. The hair strand begins to grow. Finally, the hair strand grows. It will first grow upwards until it reaches the scalp (as it pushes the telogen hair from the follicle), and then outwards.
                                    <br><br>  At any given time, 90% of your hair follicles are in the anagen phase.

                                    
                                    
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" ><br> 
                                    
                                    <span class="text99">
                                        Catagen
                                    </span> <br> <br> When the phase of active growth ceases, it is time for transition. This is the catagen phase, which lasts anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.
                                    Hair growth phase is important to understand the reasons behind hair loss
                                    The entire hair growth process takes years to complete.
                                    <br> <br> Over this time period, the bulb will detach from the DP (so it can no longer receive blood supply). The hair strand will then slowly move up in the follicle, as the follicle shrinks to push it out.
                                    <br> <br>  The strand is still held firmly in place, though normal activities (such as scratching, brushing, etc.) can dislodge it.
                                    
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" ><br>

                                    </span> <br> <br>

                                   <span style="text-align: justify;"> This is known as the resting phase and for good reason. At this time, there is little to no activity within the follicle.
                                    <br> <br>However, beneath the follicle is where the anagen phase is beginning all over again. It is at this time that the follicle will once again widen which leads to the shedding of your telogen hairs. In fact, you can expect to shed anywhere from 50 â€“ 150 telogen hairs per day.
                                    <br> <br>If a white bulb is present at the bottom, this is indicative of a hair strand shed during the telogen phase.

                       <br><br> NOTE: Improper hair growth can be linked to a number of medical causes, it may be helpful to speak with your doctor. This is especially true if you suspect a hormonal imbalance or a side effect of your medication.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;" >Our scalps produce a natural, protective substance known as sebum. When left on its own, it can coat the hair strands and protect the hair follicles from damage. When you wash your hair daily (or, even every other day), you strip your scalp of these natural oils. <br> <br>
                                As an attempt to protect your scalp, your pores will begin to overproduce the substance. This can lead to itching, irritation, and even clogging of the pores.
                                
                                To strike a balance, it is recommended to wash your hair no more often than twice per week. In fact, the less often you wash, the better! This will then give your scalp time to do its job, and there will be less risk of damage and stress on the follicles.

                                The hair is mainly composed of a structure known as keratin, a protein. Keratin plays a rather large role in the human body, as it is not only contained to the hair. It is also found in our skin and nails. And inadequate levels of protein can contribute to this structureâ€™s breakdown (12).
                                <br> <br> By adding more protein to your diet, you provide a natural source that your body can use in keratin formation. You also increase iron levels, which is a nutrient that is also important for healthy hair.
                                <br> <br> There are plenty of natural protein sources to choose from, including:
                                Eggs,
                                Chicken,

                            <p style="text-align: justify;" >Add Bone Broth to Your Weekly Routine <br> <br>
                                One great way to add protein and other nutrients to your diet is by adding bone broth to your weekly (if not daily) menu.
                                Bone broth is made when animal bones (traditionally poultry or bovine) are boiled for a long period of time. The time varies, though six to 12 hours is common with poultry and 12 to 24 is common with beef and lamb.
                                This process enables the nutrients within the bones â€“ particularly within the marrow â€“ to infuse into the water.
                                One such nutrient is collagen. Collagen is a protein thatâ€™s made up of long-chain amino acids. It plays a major role in cell maintenance and renewal and, as such, is found throughout the bodyâ€™s various tissues and organs (including hair) (13, 14, 15). In fact, collagen is essential to hairâ€™s elasticity which means a lack of collagen in your diet can lead to breakage and increased hair fall.
                                The easiest way to increase collagen intake is with a daily bone broth.
                                You can make a large batch at the beginning of the week, and then store it in the fridge for up to three days. If you want it to last longer, you can even store it in your freezer indefinitely.
                                <br> <br> Avoid Calorie Dense, Low Nutrient Foods
                                Foods like wheat, rice, and corn products may provide cheap calories that fill you up, but these food sources are often lacking nutrients and minerals. By filling your diet with these types of foods, you will be filling yourself up, but your body may be lacking the nutrients and minerals it needs to grow hair.
                                <br> <br>Add More Colorful Selections
                                Fruits and vegetables are naturally high in vitamins and minerals, and they are also high in fiber.

                        <p class="text002">To prevent lowered oxygen and even stress-driven actions, such as hair pulling, it is important to keep your stress levels in check.
                         <br> <br>   There are plenty of stress-reducing methods to try out yourself, but two you may want to try are meditation and chee breathing. 
                         <br> <br> With both of these practices, you are forced to focus on your breathing (17). You learn to take deeper, more meaningful breaths, as well as slow your thoughts and free your mind of unhelpful thoughts.
                         <br> <br> Best of all, meditation and chee breathing can have long-term impacts on your stress levels (18). This means you can preemptively treat anxiety and acute stress, all in just 20 minutes per day.

                        <p class="text002">Another way to put stress on your hair is over-styling. If hair straighteners and blow dryers are part of your regular hair care routine, there are things you can do to reduce their negative effects.
                           <br> <br> Avoid using straighteners and curling irons on wet hair.
                           <br>Add a diffuser to your hairdryer to prevent concentrated heat.
                           <br> Use a heat protectant, such as argan oil or coconut oil.
                           <br>Upgrade to a boar bristle brush to prevent unnecessary tugging.
                           <br><br> It is also a good idea to let your hair rest for as many days as possible.
