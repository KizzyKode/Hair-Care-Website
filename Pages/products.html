                <p style="text-align: justify;" >Finding the perfect product for your type of hair can be kind of a daunting task. If this is going to be the thing that finally takes you from a haplessly intolerable boy with decent hair to a haplessly intolerable man with really good hair, there's a lot of pressure not to mess it up. When you've found the one true bad-hair-day remedy, nothing else really matters, does it?

                   <br><br> If going weeks without a trip to your barber is starting to make you think you should've read a few more books while you were coasting along on the strength of your hair alone, don't you worry your pretty little head: We've rounded-up a few of the best hair creams around to keep your lettuce looking as luscious. If hair cream isn't already an essential element of your grooming regimen, it should be. Heavier than a mousse but lighter than a gel, hair cream can double as a no-frills conditioning treatment, or a styling product ideal for the shaggier look you're trying to make the most of (or for any medium or longer hairstyles, really).
                    
                   <br><br> Get with the program, guy. Treat yourself to a hair cream that'll restore your 'do to the glory of days bygone and bring back the good grooming that allowed you to avoid reading anything longer than a precisely worded text message your entire life, you beautiful bastard.<br> <br>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;" >If you take a walk down the shampoo aisle at CVS — let alone do a search for “shampoo” online — the options can make your head hurt. There are shampoos for dry hair, thinning hair, and color-treated hair, and while we’ve done deep dives into several of those categories, I was curious to hear what stylists and salon owners would suggest for some overarching favorites. So I reached out to a panel of experts to hear about their old and new standbys, the shampoos they reach for when working with clients and cleaning their own hair alike.

                    <br> <br> Before I delve into specific products, though, here are a couple of general shampooing tips: If you’re wondering how often you should wash, Brooke Jordan, co-founder and master stylist at the Bird House in Gowanus, recommends “no more than twice a week,” and when you do shampoo, try her star-shape cleaning method. “I always recommend first making sure your hair is pretty wet,” she says, “then putting about a quarter-size drop of shampoo in your hand, lathering it in your hands, and then tapping some on your head at your temples, on the top of your head at the crown, and two at the nape,” making what would look like a star of shampoo on your head. Then get to scrubbing. “Do that once, rinse, repeat and do it again,” she says. “The pattern is to your pleasure.” Now that we have that down, let’s go on to the best shampoos. <br> <br>

                            <p class="text99">Malin + Goetz Moisturizing Shampoo</p>
                            <p class="textjust">
                                Hosono is a fan of Malin + Goetz and has been using the brand’s moisturizing shampoo and cilantro conditioner in their salon for “a really long time — like eight years,” they say. According to Hosono, the shampoo works well for all hair textures, “curly to straight, thick or thin.” Despite it being sulfate free, it’s still very foamy. “I like the Malin + Goetz shampoo because it’s not 100 percent organic and it’s also not 100 percent chemical,” Hosono says. “It has both, and you really need both, especially if you have a color or anything chemical in your hair. It’s really for any hair type, and it’s not too heavy.”

                               <br> <br> Malin + Goetz’s moisturizing shampoo also receives high praise over at the Cut: “I could tell it was instantly moisturizing, and the touches of neroli and basil had a sophisticated scent that I enjoyed,” reports beauty editor and writer Jessica Prince Erlich. And Stephanie Louis, the chief executive and operating officer of Stylebox Salon in Prospect Heights, also loves the brand. “We totally agree that Malin + Goetz is rock-on awesome,” she says. “Nearly everything in the line is really, really good.” We heard about the brand when we talked to experts about the best shampoos for dandruff too. For its effectiveness on all hair types, its balance between organic and nonorganic ingredients, the high praise the brand receives overall, and the shampoo’s appeal to both women and men, we’re calling this one our best all-around.

                                “Every Davines shampoo is my favorite, but Oi is at the top because it is literally perfect,” says hairstylist Clariss Rubenstein. She recommends it for every hair type and says it leaves hair feeling silky, hydrated, and shiny. 
                                
                               <br> <br> The shampoo is infused with beta-carotene-rich roucou oil (it has 100 times more of the antioxidant than carrots, for what it’s worth), which helps hair produce melanin. Rubenstein also likes the scent, which she describes as “delicious and mild.”

                                “If I were to talk about my all-encompassing favorite shampoos and conditioners, one of my favorites is Sachajuan Normal Hair shampoo,” says Jordan. “It’s so simple and so effective, it smells amazing, and the ingredients are incredibly high quality.” Jordan tells us that while Sachajuan does use sulfates, the shampoo’s ingredients are produced in “small batches in Sweden” and that “in Europe, they have so many more regulations for their beauty products then we do, so essentially anything that’s made in Europe is sort of automatically going to be a little safer than what’s produced here.” 
                                
                               <br> <br> The brand’s products have regularly made our more specific shampoo and hair-product guides — not to mention being a favorite of Rio’s mom.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;" >Billy Madison may have famously debated whether shampoo or conditioner is better (remember the bathtub scene with the battling bottles?), but we’d like to argue that they’re equally important. Sure, shampoo does the cleansing, but conditioner is paramount for re-introducing lost moisture back to your hair. And more moisture ultimately equals strands that look smoother and shinier, not to mention are much easier to comb through and generally feel stronger and healthier. So consider conditioner to be your shampoo’s unfailing sidekick, a must-use any time you wash your hair.

                                HairCare Editorial Director Uramaeze Kizito sings the praises of this conditioner—as well as the accompanying shampoo and treatment—time and time again. The entire line targets broken protein bonds in the hair caused by things such as coloring, chemical processing, and more.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;" >Whether it's damage, dryness, flakes, frizz, or fading, we all run into hair issues. The change in seasons, indoor heat, outdoor elements and hot hair tools are only some of the culprits that can cause these changes. Luckily, you don't have to hit the store or add yet another beauty product to your Amazon cart: You can head straight to your kitchen for everyday ingredients that you can whip into a DIY hair mask to fix your mane. Treat yourself to an at-home spa day using a few simple pantry staples. You can whip up solutions for everything from scalp to strands!

                                The issue: Product buildup. Between haircare and styling products, it's easy to accumulate layers of residue. Buildup can lead to strands that look and feel greasy along with flatness and even dandruff-like flakes. Cut through excess oil and buildup with this "baking soda power cleanse" from Audrey Davis-Sivasothy, a trichologist (hair specialist) in Houston and the author of Hair Care Rehab: The Ultimate Hair Repair and Reconditioning Manual.

                              <br> <br>  Ingredients: Half a cup of shampoo, 1-2 tablespoons of baking soda

                              <br> <br> Directions: Combine shampoo with baking soda, stir well and pour over wet hair. Gently massage the mixture into the scalp and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing thoroughly.

                                The issue: Dryness. Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize — which will also help prevent split ends, frizz and breakage. if your regular conditioner isn't cutting it, opt for an intensive overnight treatment with coconut oil. "It can penetrate the hair shaft" to repair hair, says Kyle White, a colorist at Oscar Blandi Salon in New York City.

                                <br> <br>  Ingredients: 1 tablespoon of coconut oil.

                                <br> <br>  Directions: Before bed, warm coconut oil in the microwave, then massage into damp hair, avoiding the roots (Tie strands into a bun and/or cover with a shower cap or hair wrap if desired.) Shampoo in the morning.

                                The issue: Damage. Various factors can cause strand damage: styling tool overuse, haircolor, chemical treatments and more. Help counteract it with an avocado and olive oil hair mask, suggests Zingarino. "Packed with omega-3 fatty acids this treatment helps strengthen hair and add shine," she says. The benefits don't stop with strands: An avocado-based mask also "helps to rejuvenate and moisturize the scalp," says Joel Warren of The Salon Project salons in Florida, Pennsylvania and New York.

                                <br> <br>   Ingredients: Half an avocado, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of honey and 3 drops essential oil of choice.

                                <br> <br>   Directions: Stir ingredients together until fully combined, then apply to wet hair with your fingertips, starting at the bottom and working your way up. Warren suggests wrapping your hair into a bun and covering with a shower cap. To help activate the ingredients, blow dry your shower cap-covered hair for 10 minutes. Let it sit for another 20 minutes, then shampoo.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;" >If your skincare routine includes more than four steps, you probably have a serum or two in your arsenal. These lightweight formulas contain concentrated doses of various actives and complexion-enhancing ingredients, like retinol, vitamin C, and hyaluronic acid. Similarly, hair serum is any light, liquid styling product that gives your hair a boost of nourishment and finesse.

                      <br> <br>  "Serums are a very effective means of adding moisture and nutrients to hair [while] sealing it off so it can repel humidity and fight frizz," notes renowned session stylist and product developer Kevin Murphy. They can help with the effects of humidity, soften coarse hair, add shine, tame flyaways—you name it.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;" >In the world of styling products, hairspray definitely earns our vote for most improved. Forget the crispy, crunchy, stiff, shellacked hair of decades past (you've seen photos of your mom's hair in the '80s, right?). The latest and greatest formulas are more undetectable than ever, no matter their hold level.

                      <br> <br>  Speaking of which, when it comes to selecting a spray, the hold is the most important piece of the puzzle. On one side, you have flexible or light-hold formulas. "I think of these as working hairsprays — the ones to use while you're styling your hair and maybe aren't 100-percent ready to commit to a finished look," advises Mark Townsend, who works with Dove and clients like the Olsen twins and Dakota Johnson. He adds that these hairsprays are easier to brush out and still allow you to manipulate and play with your style.
                        
                      <br> <br>   In the opposite corner, strong-hold hairsprays are your finishing touch, best for locking a style in place, says Townsend. He also likes these for tamping down any errant hairs around your hairline or nape of your neck when you're sporting a polished pony or updo — similar to how you would use an edge control. Townsend likes to spray a tiny bit of hairspray on a (clean, obviously) natural-bristle toothbrush and use it to smooth down flyaways.

                                Truly an overachiever, Alterna My Hair My Canvas City Slay Shielding Hairspray serves more purposes than you'd ever expect from something calling itself a hairspray. You'll likely wash your hair well before its 72-hour humidity resistance fades, and its white charcoal gives it grease-eliminating dry-shampoo qualities. But don't just save it for the end of your styling session — its heat-protecting power makes it ideal as a pre-iron product.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;" >No matter what your hair texture or type is, a little oil can be necessary to keep hair looking and feeling hydrated. The best hair oils can also add shine and softness, plus protect the hair cuticle without adding any grease (even for people with oily hair). 

                      <br> <br>  "Rather than choosing an oil for your hair type, you should consider what you need the oil to do for your hair," says Sophia Emmanuel, a hairstylist at Crown Worthy in New York City. For example, if you're looking for something to enhance shine or softness, olive, carrot, and jojoba oils are known to be helpful. 
                        
                      <br> <br>  Avid users of hot tools like blow-dryers or straighteners, on the other hand, should reach for silicone-infused products to protect the hair's cuticle. "Silicones form a barrier, so there is no direct heat damage," says cosmetic chemist Ginger King.
                        
                      <br> <br>  Just keep in mind, says New York City-based board-certified dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, that "continued used of silicones over time can weigh down the hair, so it's important to regularly wash hair to prevent any buildup." 
                        
                      <br> <br> When you should apply hair oil in your routine all depends on your preference and what style you're trying to achieve, but Ciara Costenoble, a Paris-based hairstylist, says she layers it on right after applying leave-in conditioner. "Apply the oil to the tips of your fingers and on the ends of damp hair, working up to the mid-shaft," she says.
                        
                      <br> <br> There are so many hair oils out there that can address a slew of moisture-related issues — it's just about finding the right one for your needs.

                              <br>- Multi-use hair oil may be applied the following ways:
                              <br>- Pre-Cleanse: Apply to brushed hair and rinse out before applying shampoo to remove impurities
                              <br>- Pre-Blow Dry: Apply to towel-dried hair and blow dry as normal for additional protection 
                              <br>- Finishing: Work into the ends of the hair to control frizz, smooth and style
                              <br>- Touch-up: Apply a drop to ends throughout the day for a touch of shine as needed

Olaplex's beloved hair oil contains grapeseed oil to infuse damaged hair with much-needed moisture, but its bond-repairing properties come from bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate. This ingredient, which is found in all Olaplex products, works to repair broken disulfide bonds so your hair will feel stronger, healthier, and less prone to damage.

                              <br> - Apply 2-3 drops into your palms and rub your hands together until the product is dispersed throughout your palms and fingers. Then, use your fingers in a combing motion to evenly distribute the product from mid-lengths to ends, onto wet, damp, or dry hair. 
                              <br> - Overnight treatment: Start by sectioning hair into 2 sections, then take 1 full syringe of the Honey Infused Hair Oil for each section and fully coat hair. Braid hair and let it absorb for a few hours or overnight. If the product isn’t fully absorbed, then give hair a light rinse or cleanse.
                              <br> - Pro Tip: Wrap hair in a towel or a t-shirt after applying the Honey Infused Hair Oil to create heat and allow the product to absorb more deeply.

I can't tell you how many various different creams, gels, pastes, and pomades I've went through to find a hair product that doesn't make me look like either I just got out of a pool or Donald Trump on a windy day. Essentially, it's been either a choice between firm yet wet-looking gels or natural-looking pastes that have no hold. Fortunately, this cream does both incredibly well. Not only is it rather matte looking, but it holds my hair so unyieldingly that Thor would have a hard time messing it up. Needless to say, this may be the first hair product I may actually keep using.</p>

However, I now shower almost daily at the gym and don't have access to a hair dryer. I dislike sprays and gels, since they make me look like a Wall Street mogul or the son of the current POTUS. After my shower, I towel dry my hair and rub a SMALL amount of this into my hair and distribute it with my hands, then a brush. I brush my hair back and it stays this way for about any hour. After the hair dries, it gets softer, but still has a noticeable heft or volume. It looks good for most of the day.</p>
