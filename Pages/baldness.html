                    <p class="text002">When is balding premature? The answer for most people seems to revolve around the need to be attractive to the opposite sex. So if you are in your teens and twenties and seem to be losing a serious amount of hair, you are prematurely balding. In fact, about half the people who visit a doctor about hair loss are less than twenty years of age and worried about premature balding. <br> <br> 
                        Most cases of premature balding, like balding in general, begin with the hair becoming thin. You might start to notice that the strands of hair left on your brush are finer than they used to be, and also that you are seeing more scalp than usual through your hair. Caught at this stage, hair fall is easiest to treat and reverse.</p>

                                        Alopecia areata
                                    </span> <br> <br>

                                     Alopecia areata is the medical term for patchy hair loss. This is the diagnosis if you see smooth hairless patches around your head. Left to themselves, the patches usually regrow hair; but in a small number of cases the condition progresses to alopecia totalis (total hair loss in the head including eyebrows and lashes) or alopecia universalis (total hair loss all over the body including underarm and pubic hair).

                                    <br> <br>  Alopecia areata is generally thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction – the body’s immune system attacking its own cells (the hair follicles in this case). It is sometimes connected to thyroid dysfunctions, and sometimes to infections in other parts of the body, especially the teeth. One study at the University of Granada suggests that bacterial infections in the teeth might lead to an autoimmune reaction that attacks the hair follicles on the scalp. According to the study, the patches of hair loss are often aligned with the location of the infected teeth.

                                        Traction alopecia
                                    </span> <br> <br>
                                    In this kind of hair loss, the hair is literally pulled out of its roots. This happens when, over months or years, the hair is pulled tight in certain hairstyles for either practical or fashion reasons (pony tails, braids, cornrows, dreadlocks, rollers). Because the hair is always pulled tight, the follicles become damaged. After one strand of hair is pulled out, the newer hair from the follicles may be thinner and finer than previous hair. Over time, there is scarring or scaling in the area followed by permanent follicle death and baldness.

                                    <br> <br> Traction alopecia usually happens in certain parts of the head, and a trained person should be able to quickly identify if this is the cause of your hair loss. Hair usually stops growing in the sides of the head, or in the region above the neck in the back of the head. It is more common among Sikh men and among African, African-American, and Japanese women who wear their hair pulled tight.
                                    
                                    <br> <br> If the area of traction hair loss is rough and scaly, the prognosis is usually better than if it is shiny and smooth. Look for treatment at this stage, rather than trying to hide with hair extensions. Once the skin becomes shiny, it means the hair follicles have died.

                                    </span> <br> <br>

                                   <span style="text-align: justify;"> This is another very preventable cause of hair loss. Most people who habitually pull their hair have no idea how much damage this can do – some people pull out so much hair they go bald. When a doctor examines the area of hair fall, he will typically find the hair shafts are broken near the roots. The kind of damage is similar to that caused by traction alopecia, but while the hair loss is usually symmetrical in the former case, here it is in a pattern determined by the patient’s handedness. Left handed people pull out more hair from the left sides of their heads, and right handed people more from the right sides.

                                    <br> <br>Trichillomania is classified as a psychological disorder, and standard psychiatric literature recommends therapy for the condition. If you cannot stop pulling hair even after finding out it may be making you bald, then therapy will definitely help. For most people, fortunately, the threat of going bald is enough to stop the habit.

                    <p class="text002">A couple of centuries ago, men in England were advised to rub chicken dung on their heads to stimulate hair growth. We’ve come a long way since then. Dermatologists (skin doctors) and endocrinologists (hormones doctor) treat hair loss and trichologists specialize in treating baldness. There are medicines, special combs, and surgery to treat hair loss.  <br> <br>
                        The first line of treatment for premature hair loss is to help you hold on to the hair you do have: typically, a doctor will check if you have lifestyle factors or habits that result in hair fall. Then he/she may prescribe drugs to block the formation of DTH and stop follicles from shrinking, and to deliver more blood and more nutrients to hair. After that come surgery and then other hair replacement options. In a nutshell: 
                      <br><br>  ✓ First stop hair fall
                      <br> ✓ Try proven home treatments
                      <br> ✓ Drugs for hair fall
                      <br> ✓ Hair replacement surgery</p>
                       <div class="col-sm-12 over0">
                        <div class="col-sm-8  over1">
                            <p class="inOver">
                                <h2  class="tabtext">First stop hair fall</h2>
                                
                                
                                
                            </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;" >If you habitually pull out your hair, stop doing it. Change your hairstyle if you always wear your hair pulled tight. If you like to iron, perm, or curl your hair, give your hair a (long) break. Even though these treatments will not damage healthy hair on most people, if hair loss is becoming a serious problem, it’s a good idea to go easy and avoid “damaging” hair styles.

                               <br> <br> A doctor will also advise you to have a protein-, iron-, and calcium-rich diet. For non-vegetarians, this means more animal proteins from eggs, milk, fish, and meat, particularly red meat. In moderation, all these as part of a healthy balanced diet help men and women with diffused thinning. For vegetarians, supplementation may become necessary. Iron deficiency, more common among vegetarians and among women of childbearing age, can cause hair fall.
                                
                               <br> <br> Also, some tender loving care for yourself and for your hair will do no harm and may do lots of good. Eat a good diet and get enough exercise and sleep. Take care of your teeth also, because some research, as mentioned earlier, has linked patchy hair loss with tooth infections. Use a good quality shampoo and conditioner, keep your hair clean, use salt- and chlorine-free water to wash your hair, don’t towel roughly, let your hair air-dry, and use a comb with rounded teeth regularly to stimulate circulation.

                            <p style="text-align: justify;" >There are lots of traditional home treatments for healthy hair, and while they may not stop the process of severe hair fall, they can slow it down. They will also make your existing hair look better. Traditional Indian hair beauty treatments use eggs, onion juice, henna, gooseberries, and hibiscus flowers, usually made into a paste to be applied on the scalp and hair.

                                <br> <br>   If you go for commercially sold ‘herbal’ and ‘natural’ applications, remember that few of them are proven or even tested. Generally, something that has been around a long time will be safer than any new product, however ‘revolutionary’ it claims to be. Also, a lot of commercial ‘natural’ products (like Avacor) use drugs like minoxidil which are proven to help hair grow – ‘natural’ is just a marketing word to help them sell.
                                
                                <br> <br>  There are also innumerable other ‘specially developed’ shampoos, conditioners, other applications, and supplements available over the counter for hair fall. You need to remember that while these may be enough for some people, few of them are proven, and if your hair loss is severe, you are better off going to a competent doctor.

                        <p class="text002">Which brings us to medical treatments for premature balding – it is important to go to a reputable doctor who is experienced in treating hair fall problems. Inquire around, consult doctors, and ask if you can talk to his other patients. A good doctor should have no problems with this, and should also be able to show you before-and-after pictures of other people he has treated for hair loss.

                          <br> <br>  A doctor will first check your general health, especially if your hair is still at the thinning stage. He will look at your scalp to check if you have skin problems that can cause hair loss, and ask about your diet and possible stressors in your life. He may order tests of your thyroid, hemoglobin, and hormone levels.
                            
                          <br> <br> To address every possible cause, many doctors use a combination of medicines to treat hair loss: iron, zinc, and silica supplements, topical solutions like minoxidil (‘vasodilator’ to increase blood circulation) at various concentrations, azelaic acid (DHT blocking application), and finasteride (another medicine to suppress DHT, taken orally). Low-concentration solutions of minoxidil (2.5%) are available over the counter in the United States, but creams with a concentration of up to 12% are available with a prescription. Finasteride is prescribed only for men and can cause birth defects in male babies if taken by pregnant women.
                            
                            
                        </p>

                        <p class="inOver">
                            <h2  class="tabtext">Hair replacement surgery</h2>
                            
                            
                            
                        </p>

                        <p class="text002">If you are young and losing hair, surgery may not be the best option because you could continue to lose hair after surgery, leaving you with an unnatural top-filled and sides-scanty look. You may also need to conserve the hair you have left for a time when surgery does become an option, rather than ‘waste’ follicles for an early operation that you will almost certainly need to correct in the future.

                            <br> <br>   But if you do consider surgery, go to a doctor experienced in this particular kind of surgery. Remember that the most expensive is not always the best – clinics which regularly do hair replacement surgeries may be able to offer you lower prices than more expensive places with fewer patients that need to charge more to cover costs.
                            
                            <br> <br>   Whatever treatment you choose, remember everything takes time to show effects – for hair regrowth, you will have to wait at least four months and up to a year for visible results. You and your doctor need to be continually checking the progress and adjusting treatment to the results you see (or don’t see).
